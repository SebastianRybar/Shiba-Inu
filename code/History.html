            <h2>The History of Shiba Inus</h2>
            <br>

                <h3 class="fst-italic">Ancient Origins</h3>
                <p>The Shiba Inu's roots trace back over 2,000 years to Japan's early inhabitants. Archaeological evidence, including dog remains found alongside human settlements, suggests that early versions of the Shiba Inu were used by the Jomon people (14,000–300 BCE) for hunting small game and birds. The breed's name, "Shiba," means "brushwood" in Japanese, possibly referring to the terrain where these dogs hunted or the reddish color of their coat, which resembles autumn brushwood leaves.</p>
            <h3 class="fst-italic">Evolution and Standardization</h3>
            <p>Throughout Japan's history, the Shiba Inu evolved into three primary types based on regional differences: the Mino Shiba, the Sanin Shiba, and the Shinshu Shiba. These variations developed distinct characteristics adapted to their specific environments. However, it wasn't until the early 20th century that efforts to standardize the breed began in earnest.
                In the 1920s, as Western dog breeds were introduced to Japan, the native Shiba Inu faced a decline. Concerned Japanese dog enthusiasts began to recognize the importance of preserving their native breeds. In 1934, the first breed standard for the Shiba Inu was established, combining the best traits of the regional types. This standardization effort culminated in the breed being declared a national natural monument in 1936, highlighting its cultural significance to Japan.</p>
