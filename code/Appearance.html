            <h2>The Distinctive Appearance of Shiba Inus</h2>
            <br>
            <section>
                <h3 class="fst-italic">Size and Proportion </h3>
                    <p><strong>Height and Weight:</strong> Shiba Inus are a small to medium-sized breed. Adult males typically stand about 14.5 to 16.5 inches tall at the shoulder, while females are slightly shorter, ranging from 13.5 to 15.5 inches. Their weight usually ranges between 17 to 23 pounds for males and 15 to 20 pounds for females.</p>
                    <p><strong>Proportions:</strong>They have a well-balanced and compact body, giving them a sturdy and agile appearance. Their bodies are slightly longer than they are tall, contributing to their agile and nimble movement.</p>
                <h3 class="fst-italic">Build</h3>
                    <p><strong>Musculature:</strong> Shiba Inus possess a strong, muscular build that reflects their historical use as hunting dogs. This musculature is particularly noticeable in their thighs and shoulders.</p>
                    <p><strong>Bone Structure:</strong> Their bone structure is moderate, not overly heavy, which adds to their agility and swift movements.</p>
                <h3 class="fst-italic">Eyes</h3>
                    <p><strong>Shape and Color:</strong> Shiba Inus have small, almond-shaped eyes that are dark brown in color. Their eyes are set well apart and give them a keen and alert expression.</p>
                    <p><strong>Expression:</strong>The eyes of a Shiba Inu convey a sense of intelligence and curiosity, often appearing somewhat mischievous.</p>
                <h3 class="fst-italic">Ears</h3>
                    <p><strong>Shape and Position:</strong> Their ears are small, triangular, and set high on the head. They stand erect and are slightly forward-facing, which enhances their alert and attentive look.</p>
                    <p><strong>Texture:</strong>The ears are covered with short, dense fur, matching the texture of the fur on their head.</p>
                <h3 class="fst-italic">Color Variations</h3>
                    <p><strong>Red:</strong> The most common and iconic color, red Shiba Inus have a rich, rusty red coat with lighter cream to white markings known as "urajiro" on the chest, cheeks, throat, and underside.</p> <a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Taka_Shiba.jpg/1200px-Taka_Shiba.jpg">Red Shiba</a>
                    <p><strong>Sesame:</strong> A rare and striking color, sesame Shiba Inus have a red base coat with a black-tipped overlay that is evenly distributed.</p>   <a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/d5/0e/28/d50e2838426b05555f440d268b99a50f.jpg">Sesame Shiba</a>
                    <p><strong>Black and Tan:</strong> This variation features a black coat with tan points above the eyes, on the cheeks, inside the ears, on the legs, and the underside of the tail.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cream:</strong> Although less common, cream-colored Shiba Inus have a pale, almost white coat with the urajiro markings. This color is often considered less desirable in show standards but still adored by many enthusiasts.</p>
