                    <p><strong>Basic Obedience:</strong> Start with basic obedience training, teaching commands like sit, stay, and come. This provides mental stimulation and helps manage their behavior.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advanced Training:</strong> Engage them in advanced training or agility courses to challenge their intelligence and keep them mentally active.</p>
                <h3 class="fst-italic">Games and Challenges</h3>
                    <p><strong>Hide and Seek:</strong> Play hide and seek with treats or toys to engage their sense of smell and problem-solving abilities.</p>
                    <p><strong>Scent Work:</strong> Introduce scent work activities where they have to find hidden objects using their nose.</p>
                <h3 class="fst-italic">Early Socialization</h3>
                    <p><strong>Exposure:</strong> Expose your Shiba Inu to various environments, people, and other animals from a young age to help them become well-adjusted adults.</p>
                    <p><strong>Positive Experiences:</strong> Ensure that their early socialization experiences are positive to build their confidence and reduce anxiety.</p>
                <h3 class="fst-italic">Regular Interaction</h3>
                    <p><strong>Dog Parks:</strong> Regular visits to dog parks can help your Shiba Inu interact with other dogs, improving their social skills.</p>
                    <p><strong>Playdates:</strong> Arrange playdates with other dogs to provide controlled social interaction and help them learn appropriate behavior.</p>
